    title: "Task 1  Poaching Overview",
    scenario:
      "Over a period of three years, game wardens from the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks investigated a large poaching ring across four counties in northwest Kansas. The investigation uncovered 140 wildlife-related offences committed between 2015 and 2019. In total, nine people were charged. Wardens identified 25 illegally taken deer (mostly mule deer), as well as eight turkeys, one antelope and other wildlife. Many of the animals were taken out of season, shot with firearms while the hunters held only archery permits, or killed without any permit at all.",
    question:
      "Q1: How many deer were found to have been taken illegally during this investigation?",
    // accepting both numeric and word forms
    answers: ["25", "twenty five", "twenty-five"],
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Task 2  Penalties and Consequences",
    scenario:
      "Officials highlighted three of the nine individuals. Tayton Weeter pled guilty to 22 poaching-related charges and was ordered to pay $45,000 in fines and restitution, with his hunting licence revoked for 10 years. Tracy Weeter pled guilty to 12 charges, was fined $750, ordered to pay $1,688 in court fees and lost hunting privileges for two years. Sean Winter pled guilty to six charges, paid $5,800 in fines and restitution, had his hunting licence revoked for 12 months and also forfeited a firearm. Kansas law treats the unlawful intentional taking of trophy big game very seriously, with minimum fines of $5,000 and extra restitution based on antler size.",
    question:
      "Q2: Which individual received the largest fine and a 10-year hunting licence revocation?",
    answers: ["tayton weeter", "tayton"],

    id: 3,
    title: "Task 3  Public Responsibility",
    scenario:
      "To build the case, game wardens executed multiple physical and electronic search warrants and carried out interviews across Cheyenne, Sherman, Wallace and Logan counties. Detailed antler scoring was used to calculate restitution fees that are paid into a wildlife fund. While the exact tactics remain confidential, officials stressed that public reports are crucial. The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks urged people to call the state's dedicated poaching hotline, known as the Operation Game Thief line, whenever they witness wildlife violations.",
    question:
      "Q3: What is the name of the dedicated hotline the public is encouraged to use to report wildlife violations? (Operation ____ Thief line)",
