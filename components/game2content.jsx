                       Poaching is a major threat to wildlife and refers to the illegal hunting or capturing of animals for profit,
        such as ivory, fur, horns, or exotic pets. This practice has caused severe declines in many animal populations,
        pushing some species close to extinction.

                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                               When animals are removed from their natural habitats through poaching, ecosystems become unstable.
        Predators lose their food sources, prey populations grow uncontrollably, and natural balances within the
        food chain are disrupted. Over time, this can lead to long-term damage to biodiversity and the environment.

                            Species such as pangolins, tigers, and elephants are threatened due to illegal hunting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Over-hunting reduces population sizes, making it harder for species to recover, faster than they can reproduce.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The loss of even a single species can affect many others in the food chain, leading to an imbalance in the ecosystem.

Despite legal protections in place in many regions, poaching remains a significant threat. With their tall, curved horns and their tendency to live in areas with sparse vegetation, they are easy for hunters to follow and kill." },

Their recent decline in numbers is attributed to poaching, which occurs even within national parks. Wild water buffalo have also long been targets for hunters—both for sport and for meat. Now that they are legally protected, it's hoped that hunting levels are declining. However, economic growth within the countries where water buffalo are found may fuel the demand for wildlife products that are seen as status symbols." },
